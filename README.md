# Keyence-BZX-Z-Stack-Stitching-Macro
Automates stitching of tiled Z-stack images from Keyence microscopes in Fiji. Prompts for grid size and Z-slices, flattens subfolders, runs stitching per slice, handles padding, and outputs a complete 3D stack. Ideal for batch processing multi-tile, multi-slice datasets.
